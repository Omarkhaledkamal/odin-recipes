  <h2><strong>What is spaghetti ?</strong></h2>
  <p>Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. <br>
    Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. <br> 
    Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina.
