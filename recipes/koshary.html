  <h2><em>Instructions</em></h2>
  <h3>Make the crispy onion topping. </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sprinkle the onion rings with salt, then toss them in the flour to coat. Shake off excess flour.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat, cook the onion rings, stirring often,<br>
      until they turn a nice caramelized brown. Onions must be crispy, but not burned (15-20 minutes).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Make the Tomato Sauce.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon cooking oil. Add the grated onion, cook on medium-high until the onion turns a translucent gold <br>
      (do not brown).Now add the garlic, coriander, and red pepper flakes, if using, and saute <br>
      briefly until fragrant (30-45 seconds more)</li>
    <li>Stir in tomato sauce and pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens (15 minutes or so).</li>
    <li>Stir in the distilled white vinegar, and turn the heat to low. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Make the Koshari</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot or saucepan over high heat <br>
      Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender (15-17 minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt. <br>
      (Note: when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice). <br>
    </li>
    <li>Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and the rice in the <br>
      saucepan over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon cooking oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly. <br>
      Add warm water to cover the rice and lentil mixture by about 1 Â½ inches (you'll probably use about 3 cups of water here). Bring to a boil; <br>
      the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 minutes). <br>
      Keep covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or so.
    </li>
    <li>Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by <br>
      adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Put it All Together!</h3>
  <p>To serve, fluff the rice and lentils with a fork and transfer to a serving platter. Top with the elbow pasta and &frac12 of the tomato sauce, <br>
    then the chickpeas, and finally &frac12 of the crispy onions for garnish. Serve, passing the remaining sauce and crispy onions separately.
